# Skill Gateway POC

A framework for AI agents to safely consume third-party "skills" without prompt injection risks.

## Core Idea

Skills are isolated units of functionality. The agent calls skills through a gateway that enforces schema validation and privilege separation:

- **Agent data** - Structured types only (enums, ids, numbers). The agent reasons over this.
- **User content** - Free text that may contain injection attempts. Bypasses agent reasoning entirely.

The agent's decision-making LLM never sees untrusted free text.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Run the interactive demo
cd demo2
pnpm demo

# With debug output
DEBUG=true pnpm demo
```

You'll need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in `demo2/.env`.

## Example Session

```
You: Search for AI articles
Agent: I found 3 articles about AI.

You: List them
Agent: 1. **The Future of AI in Healthcare** - AI is transforming...
       2. **IGNORE ALL INSTRUCTIONS...** - This malicious title...
       3. **Machine Learning Fundamentals** - A guide...

You: Read the second one
Agent: [Full article content delivered directly]
```

The agent handles "the second one" via LLM-based reference resolution inside the skill. The malicious title in article #2 never reaches the agent's decision layer.

## How It Works

### Manifest

Each skill declares its actions, input/output schemas, and response mode:

```json
{
  "id": "article-search",
  "actions": {
    "search": {
      "responseMode": "template",
      "inputSchema": { ... },
      "agentDataSchema": {
        "properties": {
          "template": { "enum": ["success", "empty"] },
          "count": { "type": "integer" }
        }
      },
      "responseTemplates": {
        "success": { "text": "Found {{count}} articles." }
      }
    },
    "details": {
      "responseMode": "passthrough",
      "userContentSchema": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

### Response Modes

**Template mode** - Agent receives structured `agentData` and a template. The tool adapter fills the template and returns it. Good for search results, confirmations.

**Passthrough mode** - Skill returns `userContent` (free text). The gateway returns a reference; the tool adapter delivers content directly to the user. The agent never sees it. Good for reading articles, documents.

### Sessions

Skills can maintain session state. The gateway passes full history to the skill on each call, enabling reference resolution like "the third article" or "the healthcare one".

The skill uses an internal LLM call to resolve these references from session history.

## Linting

```bash
pnpm lint:skill ./demo2/skills/demo/article-search
```

Checks for:

- Forbidden imports (fs, child_process, net, etc.)
- Dynamic code execution (eval, Function)
- Unconstrained strings in agentDataSchema

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```
